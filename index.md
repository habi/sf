When you work in tech long enough you start to hear repeated short stories by otherwise trustworthy people. Many of these are incorrect or never happened. 

I've come to call these Silicon Folklore.

This site is a project that seeks to tackle a few questions about Silicon Folklore:

 * How and where did a story start?
 * How has it changed over time?
 * Why does it persist?
 * What's the closest we can get to the real story?

I'd like to stress that you are not a fool if you have believed these narratives. You can find them repeated in countless serious works by people and organizations with impeccable credentials.

Another goal of this project is to serve as a gentle refutation of the myths so if you see them in the wild you can encourage people to pull up siliconfolklore.com in their free time.

Lastly, I'm open to suggestions for further articles. Feel free to reach me by email: [info@siliconfolklore.com](info@siliconfolklore.com)
