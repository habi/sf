However, remember that ARPA funding was from Navy money. So while everybody=
 working on ARPANET most likely was working on resource sharing, if you wan=
t to dig, it would be interesting to find out if in the ARPA funding alloca=

Hi Christopher,

Sorry, I must have missed your earlier email. Re that line about
communications in the event of a nuclear attack, I wish I could come up
with my source for it. After the book was published, I began to wonder
about the statement and went back to verify where I had found it, and
amidst all my research materials I couldn't find the source. So I'm drawing
a blank here. I know I pulled it from more than one source but that's about
it, and I've wished I could clarify it, since it now eludes me. At this
point I wish I hadn't written it, given the trajectory of the idea as you
recount in your article. Clearly it was an egregious error.

Great article, by the way, and a real contribution.

Paul

Hi Chris!

Yes, I think it’s fair to say that I no longer have notes on this.  I’m 
sorry I couldn’t find anything!

Didn't know I had opened quite that big a can of worms.

The big missing piece in your previous draft was Licklider.
I see his name in your latest draft a few times, but much more could be 
added.

FYI, I never thought of it as two tracks. If tracks, more than two.
It's just not possible to explain everything for every audience.
In some books and articles I go into detail about Internet growth history.
In most I gloss over that, because there are other fish to fry.
Etc.

FYI, I don't know what a bazarre is. Maybe you mean bizarre.
Or perhaps bazaar as in esr's relatively famous essay that you seem to 
be alluding to,
The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

So far as I know, nobody has attempted to research the money trail.
Might be something interesting in there; might not.
No way to know without looking.

Ed Krol is not hard to find. I can ask him if he's interested, if you like.

Haven't heard from Bruce in a decade or so, but I've sent him a query to 
his last known address.

FYI, "This connection gets repeated" seems to indicate that I got it 
from Bruce.
Which is unlikely, since I was involved in the ARPANET long before Bruce.
FYI, I worked directly on the ARPANET, but I was not one of the core 
designers or implementors.
Your Peer group is probably the right place for me in your schema, 
because the Matrix is about many networks.

I do like your matrices. The first one seems to indicate it's mostly 
peer to peer. Heh. Internet joke.
Suggest you number them, as in Table (or Figure) 1, etc. for ease of 
reference by commenters.

I vaguely remember that 1991 CPSR event as an EFF event with Sen. Leahy.
Perhaps Bruce finds more significance in it.
Ah, Steve Jackson. He took his court case winnings and funded an ISP.
So we formed one and competed with him. Not relevant to your story, though.

Vint is usually willing to talk. I don't know Kleinrock.

Some time soon I can run it by a den of crusty oldtimers.
They have, ah, opinions, and aren't shy of expressing them.

    Hi,

    After working 16 or so hour days for the past week or so, I believe
    I've incorporated all of your points in your email except for two:

    1 Bruce Sterling appears to be too famous to find a way to contact.
    Do you know how I can reach out?

    2 The money trail question is fascinating. I looked into it and
    wasn't able to make solid headway. I'd likely need to travel to
    archives in DC as I kept running up against stuff that hasn't been
    digitized.

    I might do it. I've got a backlog of archives to visit now that
    they're mostly open again.

    If you'd like to see the updated article it's at
    https://***.***/nuclear-myth

    I'm going to reach out to Cerf and Kleinrock soon, who I have both
    met a few times and ask for their feedback as well.

    I'm also looking for more professional folklorists to go over it for
    methodology and practice. If you know anyone I'd love to get in
    touch with them.

    Thanks again for your knowledge and valuable opinions.  I hope
    everything is well.

            I'll pull the article until I go over everything that you've

            I hope the best for you during the storm and I'll respond
            when I've addressed all your concerns.

                And thanks for digging into Internet history; it's
                always interesting to see new material dug up.

                I'm not sure what you're getting at with your "stated
                without citation."
                I didn't see any reason to cite my own opinion which I
                previously also wrote.
                Most likely if you dig back in issues of Matrix News
                you'll find even earlier versions.

                After your question "Why didn’t he just stick with that?"

                I had to reread several times to convince myself you
                weren't attributing the Japan Information Highway
                article to me. Could you please clarify by saying
                something like "text by others".

                To directly answer your question, The Matrix is a
                history and policy book. The other two you quote are, as
                their titles indicate, about technical aspects of how to
                use the stuff. History was not the main point of those
                books. As you say, "these statements are small buried
                passages in much larger, often dry technical works."
                These particular statements were not intended to be
                complete histories of the origins of the ARPANET. They
                are indeed a bit too condensed.

                I am puzzled by your characterization, "This “ARPANET is
                one step removed from nuclear war planning” narrative".

                First of all, that doesn't seem to be what you are
                objecting to. Earlier, you wrote:
                "was /designed from the start/ to withstand a nuclear
                attack."

                Secondly, you documented the one step removed in your
                quotes from "“Recommendation to the air staff” by RAND,
                from August 1965." See also below about Licklider: RAND
                is not the only connection between nuclear war planning
                and ARPA and the ARPANET..

                Yes, I am and was well aware that the principal purpose
                of ARPANET and the Internet is resource sharing. There
                was no real need to spell that out of the readers of
                those two books, because they were reading them to learn
                how to implement that. But that is not the whole story,
                as you have started discovering. Why was resource
                sharing on peoples' minds back then? And where did the
                money come from?

                Bruce Sterling's writeup is not wrong. Sure, it's better
                than my shorthand blurb in those two books. My error is
                in the "ARPA was charged with". No, not exactly..

                You may want to ask Bruce if he read “Recommendation to
                the air staff”. I wouldn't be surprised if he did; he
                does pretty thorough research.

                Also, it's a bit unfair to characterize Bruce
                among "fabulists trying to tell compelling stories."
                That piece was history, not fiction.

                However, remember that ARPA funding was from Navy money.
                So while everybody working on ARPANET most likely was
                working on resource sharing, if you want to dig, it
                would be interesting to find out if in the ARPA funding
                allocation discussions what else was used for
                justification. It wouldn't be the first time researchers
                were busily working on a virtuous project that was being
                funded for different reasons. Let me know if you dig
                into that.

                You don't mention Licklider or his work at the Pentagon.
                See Sharon Weinberger
                <https://aeon.co/users/sharon-weinberger>, "Web of War,"
                Aeon, extract from a 2017 book.
                https://aeon.co/essays/how-nuclear-fears-helped-inspire-creation-of-the-internet
                For example:
                "Licklider was well aware of the Pentagon’s interest in
                command and control of nuclear weapons. One of his early
                descriptions for work on computer networking referenced
                the need to link computers that would be part of the
                nascent National Military Command System used to control
                nuclear weapons. His vision was for something much
                broader, however. When he met with Jack Ruina, the head
                of ARPA, and Eugene Fubini, one of Brown’s deputies,
                Licklider pitched interactive computing to them. Rather
                than focusing strictly on technologies to improve
                command and control, he wanted to transform the way
                people worked with computers. ‘Who can direct a battle
                when he’s got to write a program in the middle of that
                battle?’ Licklider asked."

                You ask: "where did people like Gilster and Quarterman
                get this idea?"

                I have no idea about Gilster.

                As for me, I don't rightly recall, it was long common
                wisdom. Since I worked at BBN, which was full of MIT
                people who knew Licklider, I would guess it was some
                derivation of Licklider's Pentagon and ARPA work. Whose
                work shows that there were indeed Cold War nuclear bomb
                roots of the ARPANET, even though that network was not
                directly designed to survive a nuclear attack.

                Errata: You mention NIRPNET. Maybe you mean NIPRnet.
                In the same sentence, it's should be its.

                You note: "If you click through the above article you'll
                see a linguistic phenomena: It's called Internet without
                the word "the" preceding it. This was pretty common
                through about 1994. "I'm on Internet" sounds weird to us
                but say, "I'm on AOL" does not - and that was basically
                the logic. It gets deeper. For instance, it's called
                "The Usenet" in the article and we actually would drop
                the "the" on that word today just like we do with
                "ARPANET", or how it used to be stylized, "ARPAnet".
                This history needs its own atticle as well."

                (Typo: atticle should be article.)

                Yes, please write an article about Internet as a proper
                name. Including the neo-logism internet without a
                capital, which is irritating, because while there are
                indeed disconnected small-i internets, there is only one
                Internet with a capital I.

                Got to go prepare for a hurricane. Thanks again for your
                research. -jsq

                          I had to reread several times to convince
                          myself you weren't attributing the Japan
                          Information Highway article to me. Could you
                          please clarify by saying something like "text

                          <div>To directly answer your question, The
                            Matrix is a history and policy book. The
                            other two you quote are, as their titles
                            indicate, about technical aspects of how to
                            use the stuff. History was not the main
                            point of those books. As you say, "these
                            statements are small buried passages in much
                            larger, often dry technical works." These
                            particular statements were not intended to
                            be complete histories of the origins of the
                            ARPANET. They are indeed a bit too
                            condensed.</div>
                          <div><br>
                          </div>
                          <div>I am puzzled by your characterization, "<span

                          First of all, that doesn't seem to be what you
                          are objecting to. Earlier, you wrote:

                          Secondly, you documented the one step removed
                          in your quotes from "“Recommendation to the
                          air staff” by RAND, from August 1965." See
                          also below about Licklider: RAND is not the
                          only connection between nuclear war planning
                          and ARPA and the ARPANET..</div>
                        <div><br>
                          <div>Yes, I am and was well aware that the
                            principal purpose of ARPANET and the
                            Internet is resource sharing. There was no
                            real need to spell that out of the readers
                            of those two books, because they were
                            reading them to learn how to implement that.
                            But that is not the whole story, as you have
                            started discovering. Why was resource
                            sharing on peoples' minds back then? And
                            where did the money come from?<span

                          Bruce Sterling's writeup is not wrong. Sure,
                          it's better than my shorthand blurb in those
                          two books. My error is in the "ARPA was
                          charged with". No, not exactly..</div>
                        <div><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>You may want to ask Bruce if he read
                          “Recommendation to the air staff”. I wouldn't
                          be surprised if he did; he does pretty
                          thorough research.</div>
                        <div><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>Also, it's a bit unfair to characterize
                          Bruce among "fabulists trying to tell
                          compelling stories." That piece was history,
                          not fiction.</div>
                        <div><br>
                          <div>However, remember that ARPA funding was
                            from Navy money. So while everybody working
                            on ARPANET most likely was working on
                            resource sharing, if you want to dig, it
                            would be interesting to find out if in the
                            ARPA funding allocation discussions what
                            else was used for justification. It wouldn't
                            be the first time researchers were busily
                            working on a virtuous project that was being
                            funded for different reasons. Let me know if
                            you dig into that.</div>

                          <div>You don't mention Licklider or his work

                          "Licklider was well aware of the Pentagon’s
                          interest in command and control of nuclear
                          weapons. One of his early descriptions for
                          work on computer networking referenced the
                          need to link computers that would be part of
                          the nascent National Military Command System
                          used to control nuclear weapons. His vision
                          was for something much broader, however. When
                          he met with Jack Ruina, the head of ARPA, and
                          Eugene Fubini, one of Brown’s deputies,
                          Licklider pitched interactive computing to
                          them. Rather than focusing strictly on
                          technologies to improve command and control,
                          he wanted to transform the way people worked
                          with computers. ‘Who can direct a battle when
                          he’s got to write a program in the middle of
                          that battle?’ Licklider asked."
                          <div><br>
                          </div>
                          <div>You ask: "where did people like Gilster
                            and Quarterman get this idea?"</div>
                          <div><br>
                          </div>

                          <div>As for me, I don't rightly recall, it was
                            long common wisdom. Since I worked at BBN,
                            which was full of MIT people who knew
                            Licklider, I would guess it was some
                            derivation of Licklider's Pentagon and ARPA
                            work. Whose work shows that there were
                            indeed Cold War nuclear bomb roots of the
                            ARPANET, even though that network was not
                            directly designed to survive a nuclear
                            attack.</div>

                          article you'll see a linguistic phenomena:
                          It's called Internet without the word "the"
                          preceding it. This was pretty common through
                          about 1994. "I'm on Internet" sounds weird to
                          us but say, "I'm on AOL" does not - and that
                          was basically the logic. It gets deeper. For
                          instance, it's called "The Usenet" in the
                          article and we actually would drop the "the"
                          on that word today just like we do with
                          "ARPANET", or how it used to be stylized,
                          "ARPAnet". This history needs its own atticle
