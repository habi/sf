Sorry,
 I must have missed your earlier email. Re that line about communications i=
n the event of a nuclear attack, I wish I could come up with my source for =
it. After the book was published, I began to wonder about the statement and=
 went back to verify where I had found it, and amidst all my research=C2=A0=
materials I couldn&#39;t find the source. So I&#39;m drawing a blank here. =
I know I pulled it from more than one source but that&#39;s about it, and I=
&#39;ve wished I could clarify it, since it now eludes me. At this point I =
wish I hadn&#39;t written it, given the trajectory of the idea as you recou=
nt in your article. Clearly it was an egregious error.

Great article, by the way, and a real contribution.
