<p>When you work in tech long enough you start to hear repeated short stories by otherwise trustworthy people. Many of these are incorrect or never happened.</p>
<p>I've come to call these Silicon Folklore.</p>
<p>This site is a project that seeks to tackle a few questions about Silicon Folklore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and where did a story start?</li>
<li>How has it changed over time?</li>
<li>Why does it persist?</li>
<li>What's the closest we can get to the real story?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to stress that you are not a fool if you have believed these narratives. You can find them repeated in countless serious works by people and organizations with impeccable credentials.</p>
<p>Another goal of this project is to serve as a gentle refutation of the myths so if you see them in the wild you can encourage people to pull up siliconfolklore.com in their free time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'm open to suggestions for further articles. Feel free to reach me by email: <a href="mailto:info@siliconfolklore.com" class="uri">info@siliconfolklore.com</a></p>
