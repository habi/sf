Notes:

Part of the theory is that as microcomputer capabilities increased, software complexity did as well and the licensing and royalty logistics of open ended, source available, higher level software became increasingly infeasible making the maintenance of a proprietary stack economically unviable outside of the consumer appliance (think smartphone) space

There's a clayton christensen style hypothesis I'm working on about how the increasing computing power of micros were more favorable to various organizational structures and that the *marketplace* success of things like linux and freebsd aren't just due to only hard work but also the context of the conditions.

It's also somewhat a crib from Eric S Raymond's cathedral/bazaar analogy

In the 1980s, an era known as the Unix Wars was in full swing and the future was all but inevitable. For instance, in the 1984 text, The Coming Computer Industry Shakeout, Stephen McLellan states "IBM may dominate the office automation market with its hardware, but AT&T has the software ... AT&T undoubtedly will come out with its own line of computer products using UNIX" portending not a rise of Microsoft and Windows but instead, AT&T and UNIX for the microcomputer market.

AT&T might have had an edge but like IBM, they were subject to the same cloning strategies that Compaq used to reverse engineer IBM's BIOS using a clean room design. This, along with the hacker ethic led to a number of clones and variations causing some splits that persists to this day.

On the ground many attempts were being made at making Unix take off on cheaper hardware. Interactive Systems Corporation, which was later bought by Kodak, the camera company, came out with IBM's first official PC Unix system called PC/IX in 1984. It cost 22 times more than DOS and Microsoft's own UNIX, Xenix, was already available. IBM claimed it didn't want to overcommit itself to a single vendor at the time. 

In fact, in 1984, there were many UNIX and lookalikes for the PC such as Venix, QNX, Coherent and IDRIS. It was already a multi-belligerent war without any market-share. Could this model eventually figure itself out? 

Then, in March 1985, Dr. Dobb's journal printed a 5-page manifesto out of Boston with an unusual dream. Excerpts:

"Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with others... Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system software. It may enable them to make more money, but it requires that they feel like competitors with other programmers rather than like comrades... The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now in use essentially forbid programmers to treat others as friends... When the kernel and a debugger are written, by the end of 1985 I hope, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system suitable for program development."

This wasn't necessarily a voice in the wilderness at the time as much as a closeted desire. Even IBM PC/IX took a Napster like attitude towards it. From Microsystems, Oct/1984:

"Although IBM markets the product to be installed as a single-user... there are enough hints in the documentation to activate login ports ...they have to pay AT&T significantly more in royalties for multiuser sublicenses ... the legal question with respect to AT&T arises: can one legitimately use PC/IX configured as a multiuser UNIX? The license agreement simply prevents one from using the software on more than one machine at a time. This not only seems to permit multiuser usage, but even multimachine usage. The implication clearly is: if you want to, you can."

The following month, Dr. Dobbs printed some letters to the editor, many in response to Stallman's manifestor

Here's a few fun excerpts:

James Glass writes "Here is a true adherent to the Hacker ethic! Mr. Stallman’s militant advocacy is enhanced by his well-written arguments."

However Robert Schwartz sees otherwise: Stallman obviously prefers the former, which is characteristic of the Marxist ideals of the Soviet Union. Me, I prefer the latter, typified by the good old capitalist U. S. of A. This was echoed by David Kettle: I believe Mr. Stallman must be suffering from a few other fantasies besides that of a public domain Unix. Jim Harlan gets at the crux of the model: ". If we follow Mr. Stallman’s philosophy, we have to elevate “society” to a higher level than the individual."

The advocacy in June 1984 for free-marketish competition arguably aligned closer to what Andy Grove, in "Only the Paranoid Survive", depicted as "The Old Vertical Computer Industry", vertical stacks with each vendor supplying the chips, computer, sales, application, and operating system, much in the style of modern day Apple. 

The was proceeded by what he calls "The New Horizontal Computer Industry - circa 1995", the year he wrote it, where each of the elements are stacked horizontally on top of each other.

The reality was that as computer systems became more power and correlatively, computer software became more complicated, so did copyright, attribution, licenses, and restrictions. From 1986, Intellectual Property Rights in an Age of Electronics and Information,

"The establishment of large libraries of reusable software modules raises questions about
ownership and the management of transactions in these resources. Difficulty is likely to arise in determining whether the copyright
ownership of a module constitutes a restraint on the use of a function or an idea."

These problems were easier to mitigate in consumer-facing experiences but in the technical world where the users write and modify the software, it became a murkier question and there were a number of lawsuits coming in the late 80s that specifically dealt with that.
