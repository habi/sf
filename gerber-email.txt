 So, let me gather a little wool about my own experience with "the Internet" and my own skepticism that the atomic myth is accepted by many whether academics or just plain folk. I was at UCLA shortly after ARPA was implemented. I remember remotely doing Political Science survey research data analysis using computers on the network, e.g. at the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. I spent many years in information technology management, building the first microcomputer based data collection, tracking and analysis system for a Cancer control program sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. That led back to UCLA where I oversaw the building of Social Sciences Computing and the first cross campus fibre optic network. I spent years in information technology journalism at a variety of online publishers. I published 5 editions of my book on Microsoft's Exchange email system, and many articles online on tech websites. I am now doing high throughput computer and network based audience analytics work for a large UK based online publisher. I never, never heard the myth that ARPAnet or the Internet was built to withstand atomic war. It couldn't then and it can't today. While I appreciate the value of exploring myth, I have to wonder how widespread the belief in this particular myth is today. Certainly anyone who uses an Internet connection has experienced outages and that's without bombs going off.
